# CyberTuesday
A quick start to creating a basic security awareness program

If you are in need of a security awareness program, but are having difficulty getting buy-in for management, this is a low effort way to get a program in the door.  This is a series of e-mails teaching security and IT awareness applicable to users both inside and outside of a corporate environment, including things such as password security, awareness of phishing scams around tax season and black friday, and social media awareness.  These were originally written for a US based audience, however, feel free to modify as you see fit.

I recommend starting with the "What Is Cyber Tuesday?" e-mail first so that users know that it is coming and to look out for furture e-mails.  Then there are 28 additional Cyber Tuesday e-mails that you can send through out the year (with some being seasonally appropriate).  After you're done with the 28, or are interested in making your own, I have included the original template file for creating further Cyber Tuesday e-mails.

Stay cool, stay safe, stay grounded.
